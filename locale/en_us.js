    content: `
    <p>Curious and fascinated by technology since I was a child, my interest in the world of computing led me to join the field of civil engineering as a designer in 2010. During this experience, I acquired valuable knowledge and skills, both professional and personal, and developed my work skills in team and communication.</p></br>
    <p>In 2014, I completed my graduation in the Systems Analysis and Development course at the University of Passo Fundo (UPF). During training, I deepened my theoretical and practical knowledge in information technology, acquiring essential skills to design, develop and implement efficient and functional software systems. I highlight my ability to analyze user needs and translate them into efficient technological solutions, in addition to my experience in developing web applications.</p></br>
    <p>After graduation, I chose to continue working in the engineering office, but I was always looking for opportunities to develop parallel projects in the area of ​​technology. In 2019, an opportunity arose to join a software company as a front-end developer. Since then, I have devoted myself more and more to my work and I am fascinated by the impact it has on people's lives.</p></br>

        <p>Recooperar is a degraded area management system developed by IBAMA in partnership with the Federal Government, PAMGIA, ICMBio, and Funai. Recooperar is a platform that enhances the management of degraded or altered areas, facilitating the recovery or restoration of native Brazilian vegetation. I used Vue.js to create an intuitive and efficient interface, allowing users to visualize and manage environmental data in an integrated manner. Recooperar is integrated with the Geospatial Environmental Information Analysis and Monitoring Platform (PAMGIA), centralizing environmental information of interest to Ibama and its partners. This integration allows for statistical and geospatial visualization of thematic data, providing active transparency and broad access to available information.</p></br>
        <p>Recooperar contributes to the restoration of legally protected areas, such as conservation units, indigenous lands, and rural settlements, as well as degraded areas on private properties, encompassing all Brazilian biomes.</p></br>

        <p> As a software developer with experience in Vue.js and Vuetify, I have participated in significant projects such as AlertaDis, Infohidro and Stormboard, in collaboration with Simepar.</p></br>
        <p>In the AlertaDis project, I worked on the development of a natural disaster alert system, which aimed to provide real-time information on weather events and other risk situations for the population. I played a key role in implementing the user interface using Vue.js and Vuetify, creating interactive and responsive components to make it easier for users to interact with alert information.</p></br>
        <p> In the Infohidro project, I participated in the development of a hydrological monitoring platform, which allowed access to data and information on river levels, rainfall and other hydrological variables. I used Vue.js and Vuetify to build the user interface, providing an intuitive and efficient experience for users to explore and interpret the hydrological data in a visually appealing way.</p></br>
        <p>In the Stormboard project, I was responsible for developing an interactive web application for viewing weather information in real time. With Vue.js and Vuetify, I created a dynamic and responsive interface that allowed users to track weather patterns, view forecasts and receive storm alerts based on data provided by Simepar.</p></br>
        <p>My experience with Vue.js and Vuetify has enabled me to create modern web applications with elegant and functional interfaces. I have solid skills in developing reusable components, managing state with Vuex, and integrating APIs to get and display real-time data. I always seek to update my knowledge and follow the latest trends in this area, in order to deliver quality technological solutions with a positive impact.</p></br>
